Information
-----------

CheMPS2 is a scientific library which contains a spin-adapted implementation 
of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) for ab initio quantum 
chemistry. This method allows to obtain numerical accuracy in active spaces 
beyond the capabilities of full configuration interaction (FCI):

* up to 40 electrons in 40 orbitals for general active spaces
* up to 100 electrons in 100 orbitals for one-dimensional active spaces, such as the pi-system of all-trans polyenes

In addition, DMRG allows to obtain the 2-RDM of the active space efficiently. 
The method is therefore ideal to replace the FCI solver in the complete active 
space configuration interaction (CASCI) and complete active space self 
consistent field (CASSCF) methods, when the active space sizes become 
prohibitively expensive for FCI. The corresponding methods are called DMRG-CI 
and DMRG-SCF, respectively. Because DMRG can handle the abovementioned active 
space sizes, it allows to obtain FCI energies for small systems such as dimers, 
while for larger systems it is ideal to treat the static/strong correlation in 
a large active space.

The design philosophy for CheMPS2 is to be a lightweight, efficient, and 
stable library. For an input Hamiltonian and targeted symmetry sector, the 
library performs successive DMRG sweeps according to a user-defined 
convergence scheme. As output, the library returns the minimal encountered 
energy as well as the 2-RDM of the active space. With the latter, various 
molecular properties can be calculated, as well as the gradient and Hessian 
for orbital rotations or nuclear displacements. In addition, several 
correlation functions can be obtained to investigate the electronic structure 
in the active space.

To gain a better understanding of how to perform DMRG calculations for
large active spaces, you are encouraged to read the
[user manual](http://sebwouters.github.io/CheMPS2/index.html) and the
[three papers](#how-to-acknowledge-chemps2) listed below.

Incorporation of the library into other codes is very simple due a
minimal API, as well as a python interface. Direct usage of the
library is illustrated in the [c++](#4-test-libchemps2) and
[python](#6-test-pychemps2) tests, which can be easily adapted
to your needs. The interfaces to [psi4](http://www.psicode.org)
and [pyscf](https://github.com/sunqm/pyscf) are described in the
[user manual](http://sebwouters.github.io/CheMPS2/index.html).

In the future, the parallelization of CheMPS2 for shared memory
architectures will be extended to a hybrid scheme with both shared
(OpenMP) and distributed (MPI) memory parallelization. In addition,
the calculation of the 2-RDM of the active space will be extended
to the 3-RDM.

Installation
------------

### 1. Dependencies

CheMPS2 can be built with [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) and depends on

-   BLAS
-   LAPACK
-   GSL ([GNU Scientific library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/))
-   HDF5 ([Hierarchical Data Format Release 5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/))

It is parallelized for shared memory architectures with the Open
Multi-Processing ([OpenMP](http://openmp.org/wp/)) API. In the future,
the parallelization of CheMPS2 for shared memory architectures will be
extended to a hybrid scheme with both shared (OpenMP) and distributed
(MPI) memory parallelization.

### 2. Download

It is advised to clone the CheMPS2 git repository from github. In your
terminal, run:

    > cd /sourcefolder
    > git clone 'https://github.com/sebwouters/chemps2'
    > cd chemps2

That way, future updates and bug fixes can be easily pulled in:

    > cd /sourcefolder/chemps2
    > git pull

### 3. Build libchemps2

The files

    /sourcefolder/chemps2/CMakeLists.txt
    /sourcefolder/chemps2/CheMPS2/CMakeLists.txt
    /sourcefolder/chemps2/tests/CMakeLists.txt
    /sourcefolder/chemps2/sphinx/CMakeLists.txt

provide a minimal compilation. In your terminal, run:

    > cd /sourcefolder/chemps2
    > mkdir build
    > cd build

CMake generates makefiles based on the userâ€™s specifications:

    > CXX=option1 cmake .. -DMKL=option2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=option3 -DBUILD_DOXYGEN=option4 -DBUILD_SPHINX=option5

1.  Option1 is the `c++` compiler; typically `g++`, `icpc`, or `clang++`
    on Linux.
2.  Option2 can be `ON` or `OFF` and is used to switch on the intel math
    kernel library.
3.  Option3 is the prefix of the installation directory; typically
    `/usr` or `/usr/local` on Linux. On my computer, libchemps2 is then
    installed in `/prefix/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` and the headers in
    `/prefix/include/chemps2`.
4.  Option4 can be `ON` or `OFF` and is used to switch on the
    possibility to compile the doxygen documentation.
5.  Option5 can be `ON` or `OFF` and is used to switch on the
    possibility to compile the user manual with sphinx.

If one or more of the required libraries are not found, use the command

    > CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=option6 CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=option7 CXX=option1 cmake .. -DMKL=option2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=option3 -DBUILD_DOXYGEN=option4 -DBUILD_SPHINX=option5

instead, where option6 and option7 are respectively the missing
colon-separated include and library paths:

    CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/my_libs/lib1/include:/my_libs/lib2/include
    CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/my_libs/lib1/lib:/my_libs/lib2/lib

To compile, run:

    > make

To install, run:

    > make install

For non-standard installation directories, please remember to append the
library path to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in your `.bashrc`.

### 4. Test libchemps2

To test libchemps2, run:

    > cd /sourcefolder/chemps2/build
    > make test

The tests only require a very limited amount of memory (order 10-120 MB).

### 5. Build PyCheMPS2

PyCheMPS2, a python interface to libchemps2, can be built with
[Cython](http://cython.org/). The installation is independent of
CMake and assumes that you have installed the CheMPS2 library with
`make install`. For non-standard installation directories of CheMPS2,
please remember to append the library path to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in
your `.bashrc`. In addition, the include path should be appended
to `CPATH`:

    > export CPATH=${CPATH}:option3/include
    
where `option3` is the option provided to CMake with
`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=option3` above. Then the python wrapper can
be installed with:

    > cd /sourcefolder/chemps2/PyCheMPS2
    > python setup.py build_ext -L ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    > python setup.py install --prefix=option3

On my machine, the python wrapper is installed to the folder
`option3/lib/python2.7/site-packages`, but the folder `lib` and
the distribution of python can vary.

Compilation of PyCheMPS2 occurs by linking to the `c++` library in the
installation directory. The installation of PyCheMPS2 will fail if that
library is not properly installed. If you have pulled a newer version of
CheMPS2, please remember to reinstall the `c++` library first, before
reinstalling PyCheMPS2!


### 6. Test PyCheMPS2

To test PyCheMPS2 (remember that the python site-packages folder can vary),
run:

    > cd /sourcefolder/chemps2/PyCheMPS2/tests
    > export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:option3/lib/python2.7/site-packages
    > python test1.py
    > python test2.py
    > python test3.py
    > python test4.py
    > python test5.py
    > python test6.py
    > python test7.py
    > python test8.py
    > python test9.py

If you compiled the `c++` library with `-DMKL=ON`, you might get the
error

    Intel MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load libmkl_avx.so or libmkl_def.so.

This issue of using Intelâ€™s MKL inside python is known and reported. To
get the python tests to run, you can set the variable `LD_PRELOAD` in
order to preload libmkl\_rt.so. On my system, this is done with

    > export LD_PRELOAD=/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_rt.so

The python tests do exactly the same thing as the `c++` tests above, and
illustrate the usage of the python interface to libchemps2. The tests
should end with a line stating whether or not they succeeded. They only
require a very limited amount of memory (order 10-120 MB).

### 7. Doxygen

To build the doxygen manual, the `BUILD_DOXYGEN` flag
should have been on: `-DBUILD_DOXYGEN=ON`. In your terminal, run:

    > cd /sourcefolder/chemps2/build
    > make doc
    > cd LaTeX-documents
    > make
    > evince refman.pdf &
    > cd ../html
    > firefox index.html &
    
### 8. Sphinx user manual

To build the sphinx user manual, the `BUILD_SPHINX` flag
should have been on: `-DBUILD_SPHINX=ON`. In your terminal, run:

    > cd /sourcefolder/chemps2/build
    > make sphinx
    > cd sphinx/html
    > firefox index.html &

List of files to perform test runs
----------------------------------

[tests/test1.cpp.in](tests/test1.cpp.in) contains several DMRG ground
state calculations in different symmetry sectors for the N2 molecule (d2h
symmetry) in the minimal STO-3G basis set.

[tests/test2.cpp.in](tests/test2.cpp.in) contains a ground state DMRG
calculation of the ^1A1 state of H2O (c2v symmetry) in the 6-31G basis set.

[tests/test3.cpp.in](tests/test3.cpp.in) contains a ground state DMRG
calculation of the ^1A1 state of CH4 (c2v symmetry) in the STO-3G basis set.

[tests/test4.cpp.in](tests/test4.cpp.in) contains a ground state DMRG
calculation of the ^6A state of a linear Hubbard chain (forced c1 symmetry)
with 10 sites and open boundary conditions, containing 9 fermions (just below
half-filling).

[tests/test5.cpp.in](tests/test5.cpp.in) contains an excited state DMRG
calculation in the ^1Ag symmetry sector of N2 (d2h symmetry) in the minimal
STO-3G basis set. The ground and two lowest excited states are determined.

[tests/test6.cpp.in](tests/test6.cpp.in) contains a state-averaged
DMRG-SCF calculation of the first excited state of the ^1Ag sector of O2 (d2h
symmetry) in the CC-pVDZ basis set. The two 1s core orbitals are kept frozen,
and two Ag, B2g, B3g, B1u, B2u, and B3u orbitals are chosen as active space. A
significant speedup is obtained with DIIS.

[tests/test7.cpp.in](tests/test7.cpp.in) reads in
[tests/matrixelements/O2.CCPVDZ.FCIDUMP](tests/matrixelements/O2.CCPVDZ.FCIDUMP),
stores these matrix elements to disk, reads them back in from disk, and
compares the two versions.

[tests/test8.cpp.in](tests/test8.cpp.in) contains a DMRG-SCF ground state
calculation of the ^1Ag state of N2 (d2h symmetry) in the CC-pVDZ basis set.
The two 1s core orbitals are kept frozen. The next two Ag and B1u orbitals
(sigma bonding and antibonding), as well as one B2g, B3g, B2u, and B3u orbital
(pi bonding and antibonding) are chosen as active space. A significant speedup
is obtained with DIIS. This test is smaller than test6, and is included for
debugging with valgrind.

[tests/test9.cpp.in](tests/test9.cpp.in) is a copy of
[tests/test8.cpp.in](tests/test8.cpp.in), with a slightly larger active
space and which works with ordered localized orbitals instead of natural
orbitals. The localization occurs by means of Edmiston-Ruedenberg, and the
ordering based on the Fiedler vector with the exchange matrix as cost function.

[tests/matrixelements/CH4.STO3G.FCIDUMP](tests/matrixelements/CH4.STO3G.FCIDUMP)
contains the matrix elements for test3.

[tests/matrixelements/H2O.631G.FCIDUMP](tests/matrixelements/H2O.631G.FCIDUMP)
